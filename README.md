WeatherPanel
============

My wife is always wondering about the weather, if it going to be too hot today, too hunid, and what about the rest of the week. So I deciced to create a LED panel display for her that would answer all her questions and give me an excuse to learn about LED Panels.

This work is based largely on the work of others and I try to give credit where I can

This project was written in python on a Raspberry Pi 3B+, however almost any RPi can be used that supports WiFi. I actually run the project on a Raspberry Pi Zero WH. The project evolved as I learned more and more about using LED Panels and writing large python projects, so I am sure there are multiple places where the code can be made better, feel free to give me feedback. Here is an example of what the completed project looks like.
