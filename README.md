WeatherPanel
============

My wife is always wondering about the weather, if it going to too hot today, too hunid, what about the reast of the week. So I deciced to create a LED panel display for her that would answer all her questions and give me an excuse to learn about LED Panels.

Ok, full disclosure, the lockdown was deriving me nutz and I really didn't care all that much about the weather, I just needed something to do.

This work is based largely on the work of others and I try to give credit where I can
